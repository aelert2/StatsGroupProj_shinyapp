### Figure 3: Success Rate of Two-Point Conversions Based on Score Differential and Game Time Remaining

This figure explores the how the success rate of two-point conversions
varies on score diffential and minutes remaining in the game, which are
two commonly use predictors to decide whether to go for two or not. The
success rate hovers around 50% across all score differentials and
minutes remaining in the game, which shows that game situations are not
great predictors of two-point conversion success rate.
