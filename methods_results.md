Methods and Results
===================

We tried a couple statistical methods to predict whether a two-point
conversion would be successful or not. We shared our work and results
here. <br> <br>

Model 1: Logistic Regression
----------------------------

We created a logistic regression model to determine what variables were
significant in predicting the success probability of a two-point
conversion. Because we are testing our thesis that a run play is a more
successful option than a pass play, we included numerous variables that
quantify the teamâ€™s success with running the ball in the game up until
the two-point conversion attempt. <br>

    glm_twopt <- glm(two_point_conv_result ~ prop_runs_greater_than_2_yards + prop_passes_greater_than_2_yards + total_pass_yards + total_run_yards + num_runs + num_passes + avg_yds_per_play + completion_percentage + play_type + score_differential + avg_yards_per_run + avg_yards_per_pass + score_differential + game_seconds_remaining + third_down_conv_percentage, family = binomial(link= "logit"), data = two_points, na.action = na.exclude)

<br> We then used the stepAIC function to select the best predictors to
use in our logistic regression model. This is the model that the stepAIC
function selected.

### Model 1: Data Visualization

We use a binomial modeling technique to graph relationship between
probability of successful two-point conversion and the predictors. <br>
<br> **The probability of two point conversion success increases as the
number of total passing yards increases.**

    ggplot(two_points, aes(x = total_pass_yards, y = two_point_conv_result)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      stat_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family="binomial"), se = FALSE) +
      labs(x = "Total Passing Yards (Up Until to the 2PT Conv. Attempt)", y = "Probability of 2PT Conv. Success")

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'

    ## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth).

    ## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

descreases as the number of passes thrown by the possession team
increases.**

    ggplot(two_points, aes(x = num_passes, y = two_point_conv_result)) +

      stat_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family="binomial"), se = FALSE) +
      labs(x = "Number of Pass Attempts (Up Until to the 2PT Conv. Attempt)", y = "Probability of 2PT Conv. Success")

<br> <br> <br> <br> **The probability of two point conversion success
descreases when there is more time remaining in the game.**

      stat_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family="binomial"), se = FALSE) +

Model 2: Support Vector Machine
-------------------------------

For further exploration, we implemented a Support Vector Machine to attempt to find an optimal boundary to predict whether a two-point conversion would be successful or unsuccessful depending on game features leading up to that two-point conversion play. 

Based off of the implementation below, we predicted on our out-of-sample dataset with 49% accuracy, which is just below chance for our dependent variable. This low accuracy could be attributed to overfitting within the model. Further work to improve this model would be to optimize the hyperparameters. This could include possibly trianing with more data, or removing irrelevant input features.

    accuracyList = 0
    for (i in (1:100)){
      variables_lowCorrelation <- na.omit(variables_lowCorrelation1)
      n <- nrow(variables_lowCorrelation)
      ntrain <- round(n*.9)
      svm_plays <- sample(n, ntrain)
      train_plays <- variables_lowCorrelation[svm_plays,]
      test_plays <- variables_lowCorrelation[-svm_plays,]
      
      model <- svm(formula = two_point_conv_result ~ ., data = train_plays, type = 'C-classification', kernel = 'polynomial')
      
      radialPredict = predict(model, test_plays)
      confusion <- confusionMatrix(table(test_plays$two_point_conv_result, radialPredict))
      accuracyList <- accuracyList + confusion$overall[["Accuracy"]]
    }

    accuracyList/100

Model 3: Principle Component Analysis
-------------------------------------

To help reduce the feature space in our svm, we attempted to use PCA. The output of PCA on our dataset below did not help us identify variables for extraction, or elimination. We believe that this is due to the fact that our variables are correlated to eachother.   <br>

    run.pr <- prcomp(svm_df[1:15], center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)

    fviz_pca_ind(run.pr, geom.ind = "point", pointshape = 21, 
                 pointsize = 2, 
                 fill.ind = as.factor(svm_df$two_point_conv_result), 
                 col.ind = "black",
