Methods and Results
===================

We tried a couple statistical methods to predict whether a two-point
conversion would be successful or not. We shared our work and results
here. <br> <br>

Model 1: Logistic Regression
----------------------------

We created a logistic regression model to determine what variables were
significant in predicting the success probability of a two-point
conversion. Because we are testing our thesis that a run play is a more
successful option than a pass play, we included numerous variables that
quantify the teamâ€™s success with running the ball in the game up until
the two-point conversion attempt. <br>

    glm_twopt <- glm(two_point_conv_result ~ prop_runs_greater_than_2_yards + prop_passes_greater_than_2_yards + total_pass_yards + total_run_yards + num_runs + num_passes + avg_yds_per_play + completion_percentage + play_type + score_differential + avg_yards_per_run + avg_yards_per_pass + score_differential + game_seconds_remaining + third_down_conv_percentage, family = binomial(link= "logit"), data = two_points, na.action = na.exclude)

<br> We then used the stepAIC function to select the best predictors to
use in our logistic regression model. This is the model that the stepAIC
function selected.

### Model 1: Data Vis

We use a binomial modeling technique to graph relationship between
probability of successful two-point conversion and the predictors. <br>
<br> **The probability of two point conversion success increases as the
number of total passing yards increases.**

    ggplot(two_points, aes(x = total_pass_yards, y = two_point_conv_result)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      stat_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family="binomial"), se = FALSE) +
      labs(x = "Total Passing Yards (Up Until to the 2PT Conv. Attempt)", y = "Probability of 2PT Conv. Success")

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'

    ## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth).

    ## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

<br> <br> <br> <br> **The probability of two point conversion success
descreases as the number of passes thrown by the possession team
increases.**

    ggplot(two_points, aes(x = num_passes, y = two_point_conv_result)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      stat_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family="binomial"), se = FALSE) +
      labs(x = "Number of Pass Attempts (Up Until to the 2PT Conv. Attempt)", y = "Probability of 2PT Conv. Success")

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'

<br> <br> <br> <br> **The probability of two point conversion success
descreases when there is more time remaining in the game.**

      geom_point() + 
      stat_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family="binomial"), se = FALSE) +
      labs(x = "Game Minutes Remaining (At the 2PT Conv. Attempt)", y = "Probability of 2PT Conv. Success")
