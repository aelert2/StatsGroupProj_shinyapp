Modeling
========

We tried a couple statistical methods to predict whether a two-point
conversion would be successful or not. We shared our work and results
here. <br> <br>

Model 1: Logistic Regression
----------------------------

We created a logistic regression model to determine what variables were
significant in predicting the success probability of a two-point
conversion. Because we are testing our thesis that a run play is a more
successful option than a pass play, we included numerous variables that
quantify the teamâ€™s success with running the ball in the game up until
the two-point conversion attempt. <br>

    glm_twopt <- glm(two_point_conv_result ~ prop_runs_greater_than_2_yards + prop_passes_greater_than_2_yards + total_pass_yards + total_run_yards + num_runs + num_passes + avg_yds_per_play + completion_percentage + play_type + score_differential + avg_yards_per_run + avg_yards_per_pass, family = binomial(link= "logit"), data=two_points, na.action = na.exclude)

### Model 1: Data Vis

Uses a binomial modeling technique to graph relationship between
probability of successful two-point conversion and changing x axis

    #Increasing probability of two point conversion success based on number of total passing yards
    pass_yards_convprob <- ggplot(two_points, aes(x = total_pass_yards, y = two_point_conv_result)) + 
      geom_point() + 
      stat_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family="binomial"), se = FALSE)

    pass_yards_convprob

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'

    ## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth).

    ## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
