Data Source
===========

<br> Our data originates from Kaggle, where researchers compiled data
for [every play of every NFL game from
2009-2018](https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016).
This dataset was massive, and cleaning it took up the maximum space on
our original github repo, which can be found here:
<a href="https://github.com/aelert2/StatsGroupProject" class="uri">https://github.com/aelert2/StatsGroupProject</a>.
<br> <br> Because we are unable to push the full file to this shiny app
repo, we want to showthe dplyr chains that we used to create our primary
datasets, post\_td\_plays.csv, and two\_point\_attempts.csv <br> <br>

post\_td\_plays.csv
-------------------

<br> We read in the play-by-play data, as well as a file that contained
Vegas oddsmakerâ€™s betting data and weather data. Following a join, we
selected the columns that we felt provided valuable context to the two
point conversions. We kept most columns, but removed some that were
totally irrelevant. Afterwards, we filter it down to just the rows that
involve plays following a touchdown, which are extra-point kicks and
two-point conversions. We also filter out penalties.

two\_point\_attempts.csv
========================

<br> Here you can see a chain of mutations that we make to the
play-by-play dataset that cumulatively total different statistics as the
game progresses. Similar to the post\_td\_plays datset, we select them
into a smaller file, and filter it down into instances of two-point
attempts. This way, in each of our rows where a two-point attempt
happens, these columns provide statistics that show how successful teams
have been offesnively up to that point in the game.
