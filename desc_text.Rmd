Our project uses two large datasets:
<br>
1. [A NFL play-by-play data from 2009 to 2018 from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016)
<br>
2. [A betting and weather dataset from Kaggle](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=get+link!&atb=v156-1&ia=web) focusing on the spread, over/under line, stadium type, and weather conditions
<br>
<br>
The [extra point yard line was moved](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000493347/article/nfl-moves-extra-point-to-15yard-line-for-2015-season) from the 2-yardline to the 15-yardline in 2015 because the NFL wanted to increase the number of 2-point conversion attempts to boast ratings. We want to analyze how attempting more 2-point conversions, especially in the 4th quarter, can benefit teams by measuring the win probability added (WPA) after a successful 2-point conversions compared to an extra point kick. [WPA](http://archive.advancedfootballanalytics.com/2010/01/win-probability-added-wpa-explained.html) measures each play in terms of how much it increased or decreased a teamâ€™s chances of winning the game.
